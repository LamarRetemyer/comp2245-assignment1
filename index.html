 <p>[Hey good day Dr. Lyn Fatt. I hope that you can see this. My name is Lamar. I am 21 years old, and I live in Antigua. I love football, anime and music. I actually enjoy music out of all that I have listed there. I work at a supermarket called First Choice. I do pricing work there. My dream is to be competent in all types of coding. Cheers to a great semester]</p>
